# Netflix Clone ðŸŽ¬

A simple Netflix clone built with **React**, **Firebase Authentication**, and the **TMDB (The Movie Database) API** to fetch movie and TV show data.

## Features
- Browse trending, popular, and upcoming movies/TV shows
- Watch trailers and view details
- User authentication (Sign Up / Login) with Firebase
- Responsive UI similar to Netflix

## Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- Firebase Authentication
- TMDB API
- CSS

## Important Note ðŸš¨
The TMDB API is not currently accessible on some Indian networks.  
- If you are in India, the API may not work without a **VPN**.  
- When connected via VPN (for example, to US/Europe servers), the API works fine.  
- This issue is due to TMDB hosting restrictions, not the code itself.  

## How to Run
Clone this repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kundangupta04/Netflix-clone.git
   cd Netflix-clone
